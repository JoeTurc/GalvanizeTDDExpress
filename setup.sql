A battle with the criminal mastermind, Lex Luthor, ends with Superman hurling a nuclear warhead into space where it explodes, but not harmlessly. Instead, it frees the Kryptonian threesome from their other-dimensional prison. They soon discover they have almost unlimited power (the same powers, in fact, as Superman), which they use to take over the Earth.

On a cold winter day, her damaged car with her expensive fur coat is found abandoned at the side of a country road. While the authorities initially suspect that she could have committed suicide, her pompous husband, Col. Archibald Christie, who is less than cooperative with the authorities, is adamant that she is still alive. What he doesn''t tell them is that he recently asked her for a divorce so that he could marry his secretary, Miss Nancy Neele. Although the divorce request was not a total surprise since she knew of the extramarital affair, Mrs. Christie still did not want to grant him the request since she still loves him. Concurrently, American newspaper columnist Wally Stanton was scheduled to conduct an interview with Mrs. Christie. Since he can no longer do so with her disappearance, Stanton instead tries to find out himself what happened to her. He manages to track her to a resort spa hotel in Harrogate, she who is living openly there but under an assumed name, and he who does not disclose his own identity to her when he meets her. Stanton''s goal is not only to find out what she is up to, but to protect her good name which means not allowing the authorities to find her before he uncovers her motives. Stanton''s own motives end up being more than just wanting an exclusive story.','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjlkYWFjNzAtY2U5NS00NTBkLWFhN2MtOWY5OTA0NDJlNzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SX300.jpg','Warner Bros.','PG','1979-02-09','True','105 min','movie','N/A','Kathleen Tynan (screenplay by), Arthur Hopcraft (screenplay by), Kathleen Tynan (story by)','1979','6.3','2,670','tt0078736','Agatha','N/A'),(320,'Joan Hickson, Peter Tilbury, Frank Gatliff, Barbara Franceschi','1 nomination.',NULL,'UK',NULL,'David Tucker','Crime, Drama, Mystery','English','N/A','Miss Marple receives a most interesting request from Mr. Jason Rafiel, with whom she''d struck an acquaintance some years before.

Not only did Mr. Rafiel live in the area it is also where his son Michael was accused, though never convicted, of murdering his fiancée, Verity Hunt.

The subtitles seem to serve as a medium for the director''s deliberations as the TV film progresses, starting with the following manifesto: \"I have no desire to save you or admonish you or get to know you. But I would like to try to entertain you for a while with words, sounds, and images\". Alternating with poetry readings from the studio the second half of the film consists of moments from the 1970 Tour de France, including the cobbled roads of Northern France, from Mont Ventoux, and from the cathedral dash in Rouen, which is seen no fewer than three times. The subtitles in these sequences clearly point towards Leth''s cycling films proper and the statement is made that \"This is not a poem but a bit of down-to-earth truth about things I know about\". A very long shot of a spread-out field passing a pavé also points towards A Sunday in Hell a piece of real time is shown passing, for example. In the studio a peculiar device is created by which we cut from the horizontal movements of one camera to the identical movements of the other, or similarly between two zooms onto Leth or two almost identical half-close-ups of him.

The story opens in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the controversial Jesus--who has performed ''miracles'' and has publicly announced that he is ''the Son of God''--is arrested and taken back within the city walls of Jerusalem. There, the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy; subsequently, his trial results with the leaders condemning him to his death. Jesus is brought before Pontius Pilate, the prefect of the Roman province of Judaea, for his sentencing. Pilate listens to the accusations leveled at Jesus by the Pharisees. Realizing that his own decision will cause him to become embroiled in a political conflict, Pilate defers to King Herod in deciding the matter of how to persecute Jesus. However, Herod returns Jesus to Pilate who, in turn, gives the crowd a choice between which prisoner they would rather to see set free--Jesus, or Barrabas. The crowd chooses to have Barrabas set free. Thus, Jesus is handed over to the Roman soldiers and is brutally flagellated. Bloody and unrecognizable, he is brought back before Pilate who, once again, presents him to the thirsty crowd--assuming they will see that Jesus has been punished enough. The crowd, however, is not satisfied. Thus, Pilate washes his hands of the entire dilemma, ordering his men to do as the crowd wishes. Whipped and weakened, Jesus is presented with the cross and is ordered to carry it through the streets of Jerusalem, all the way up to Golgotha. There, more corporal cruelty takes place as Jesus is nailed to the cross--suffering, he hangs there, left to die. Initially, in his dazed suffering, Jesus is alarmed that he has been abandoned by God his father. He then beseeches God. At the moment of his death, nature itself over-turns.','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY1N2IyYWMtZTY4OS00OGM1LTkxNmUtOTQzYmM5MmI2YmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg','Newmarket Film Group','R','2004-02-25','True','127 min','movie','N/A','Benedict Fitzgerald (screenplay), Mel Gibson (screenplay)','2004','7.2','207,356','tt0335345','The Passion of the Christ','$368,000,000'),(361,'Maria Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, André Berley, Maurice Schutz','3 wins & 2 nominations.',NULL,'France','1999-11-09','Carl Theodor Dreyer','Biography, Drama, History','French','N/A','The sufferings of a martyr, Jeanne D''Arc (1412-1431).

Idealized as a world of luxury and privilege, for the first time an independent film crew has gained exclusive and unprecedented access and reveals the marketing machine that powers these temporary palaces of illusion. Through Judy Romano, a charismatic and iron-willed event manager, we are drawn into a world of publicists, designers, corporates and celebrities and follow her army from the planning stages right through the event as they try to maintain Emirates Airline''s position as the most publicized and envied party in the Birdcage. But her rivals have been busy and this year the challenge will be greater than ever. While Judy and the troops set about transforming their marquee into a lavish hunting lodge, complete with hard walls, a faux fireplace and fully-plumbed porcelain toilets, rivals like champagne maker Moet have enlisted a famous architect and cosmetics giant L''Oreal is creating a lipstick inspired mini-mansion. Enter the marquee on Melbourne Cup Day as the rich and famous rub shoulders with key clients and more than fifty caterers, cleaners, security guards and hairdressers work overtime to pamper their guests and wow the media. Visit rival marquees unleashing their own publicity weapons as the Birdcage becomes a spectacular celebration of excess that is both compelling and repulsive, an insular fantasy-land where most won''t even see a horse. During the event, candid interviews with key publicists and event managers reveal the web of planning and control behind an event that is bankrolled by marketing budgets. Original, insightful and irreverent, it goes beyond the seemingly frivolous to examine how our deepest desires and aspirations are manipulated by the companies in the business of selling luxury.','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMzk5MTI4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkyMDU3MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg','N/A','N/A','2006-01-09','True','26 min','movie','N/A','N/A','2006','N/A','N/A','tt3704946','Inside the Birdcage','N/A'),(373,'N/A','N/A',NULL,'UK',NULL,'Jamie Jones','Short, Drama','English','N/A','N/A','N/A','N/A','N/A','2011-09-18','True','N/A','movie','N/A','Jamie Jones','2011','N/A','N/A','tt3780286','The Birdcage','N/A'),(374,'Edward Chapman, Geoffrey Chater, Christopher Hodge, Margo Johns','N/A',NULL,'UK',NULL,'N/A','Comedy, Drama','English','N/A','N/A','N/A','N/A','N/A','1954-06-22','True','75 min','movie','N/A','Margery Sharp','1954','N/A','N/A','tt4797032','The Birdcage Room','N/A'),(375,'Lulu Guinness, Adam Wright','N/A',NULL,'UK',NULL,'Dee Koppang O''Leary','Documentary, Short','English','N/A','A short film about Lulu Guinness OBE, and Robotics Expert - Adam Wright, developing & creating the worlds first moving and singing handbag.

Even though he is looking to avoid trouble, trouble has a way of finding him: a group of Christian human rights missionaries, led by Michael Burnett and Sarah Miller, approach Rambo with the desire to rent his boat to travel up the river to Burma. For over fifty years, Burma has been a war zone. The Karen people of the region, who consist of peasants and farmers, have endured brutally oppressive rule from the murderous Burmese military and have been struggling for survival every single day. After some inner contemplation, Rambo accepts the offer and takes Michael, Sarah, and the rest of the missionaries up the river. When the missionaries finally arrive at the Karen village, they find themselves part of a raid by the sadistic Major Pa Tee Tint and a slew of Burmese army men. A portion of the villagers and missionaries are tortured and viciously murdered, while Tint and his men hold the remainder captive. Concerned by their disappearance, the minister in charge of the mission gathers a group of mercenaries and pleas Rambo transport them with his boat, since he knows their last exact location.

In basic training, they are only two of a bunch of misfits that comprise their platoon. However, it is still John that is constantly butting heads with their drill sergeant, Sergeant Hulka. Two of their saving graces are Stella and Louise, two MPs who get them out of one scrape after another. Their entire platoon is in jeopardy of not graduating. But what happens during basic leads to their entire platoon being assigned to an overseas mission in Italy, to test a new urban assault vehicle, the EM-50 project. John and Russell decide to take the EM-50 for an unauthorized test drive to visit Stella and Louise who have been reassigned to West Germany. In the process, the rest of the platoon, Hulka, and Hulka''s immediate superior, self-absorbed Captain Stillman, get caught unofficially behind enemy Communist lines in Czechoslovakia. John and Russell, with Stella and Louise''s help, will have to show their true mettle as US army soldiers and in the process test the capabilities of the EM-50 to rescue their platoon without the rest of the US army knowing what''s going on, and thus without any assistance beyond themselves.','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NzU2NjYyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1MzQxMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg','Columbia Pictures','R','1981-06-26','True','106 min','movie','N/A','Len Blum, Daniel Goldberg, Harold Ramis','1981','6.9','62,119','tt0083131','Stripes','N/A'),(688,'Bruce Greenwood, Hayden Panettiere, Caspar Poyck, Gary Bullock','3 nominations.',NULL,'USA','2005-05-10','Frederik Du Chau','Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Family, Sport','English','43','In the middle of a raging thunderstorm, a traveling circus accidentally leaves behind some very precious cargo--a baby zebra. The gangly little foal is rescued by horse farmer Nolan Walsh, who takes him home to his young daughter Channing. Once a champion thoroughbred trainer, Walsh has given up horse training for a quiet life with Channing on their modest Kentucky farm. The little zebra, or \"Stripes,\" as Channing calls him, is soon introduced to the farm''s misfit troupe of barnyard residents, led by a cranky Shetland Pony named Tucker and Franny, a wise old goat who keeps the family in line. The group is joined by Goose, a deranged big-city pelican who''s hiding out in the sticks until the heat dies down in Jersey. The un-aptly named bloodhound Lightening keeps a lazy eye on goings-on at the farm - in between naps. The Walsh farm borders the Turfway Racetrack, where highly skilled thoroughbreds compete for horse racing''s top honor, the ultra-prestigious Kentucky Crown. From the first moment Stripes lays eyes on the track, he''s hooked--he knows that if he could just get the chance, he could leave all those other horses in the dust. What he doesn''t know is--he''s not exactly a horse. But with characteristic zeal, he devotes himself to training for the big time, with a little help from Tucker, who has coached a host of champion racehorses in the past.','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDA2MTQwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYxNDcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg','Warner Bros.

The movie takes you through Valjeans life and many crossroads that shape his life. My words don''t do this movie justice. This is a must see Drama.

There he is taught to read and write by another prisoner and meets Javert, an obsessive policeman who was himself born to convict parents aboard a prison ship. After his release, Valjean is treated as a pariah but finally finds shelter in the home of a kindly bishop. Valjean repays the clergyman''s generosity by stealing his silver plate. He is apprehended by the authorities and returned to the bishop but is amazed when the kindly old priest tells them that the valuable plates were a gift. This becomes a transforming experience for the ex-convict, who establishes himself under an assumed name in a small country village as factory manager and ultimately mayor. Unfortunately the newly-promoted Javert is assigned there as chief inspector. Although he doesn''t recognize his old nemesis at first, the two clash over Javert''s overzealous prosecution of the letter of the law. When a mentally challenged homeless man is arrested and accused of being Valjean, the conscience-ridden parole violator reveals his true identity to the court and the already suspicious Javert.

Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can''t. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable. The horse''s head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, \"I''ll give him an offer he can''t refuse\"\" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don''t know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.\"','An iconic film',1,NULL,'tt0068646');
